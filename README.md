# Ajax

Sample of using Ajax to search on website box using PHP and MySQL.

Download or clone the repository and create any database in PHPMyadmin.

Update the database information in Search.php file.

Run the code via browser.

Found a open source project help that I used to do my sample on https://github.com/codeforgeek/ajax-box-php/archive/master.zip
He has a good live demo here : http://demo.codeforgeek.com/ajaxbox/
